# Wascana C/C++ Tools for Eclipse

Wascana is a collection of Eclipse CDT extensions and toolchains for common open platforms.
Immediate plans are to support the Minimalist GNU for Windows (MinGW), Arduino, and Raspberry Pi.
Other platforms may be added in the future as the community shows interest.

The common them is to provide a one stop shop and a single point of install that includes both
the CDT extensions, but also the toolchains as well, everything needed to build applications
for those platforms.
