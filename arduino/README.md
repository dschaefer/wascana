Set up steps for test environment

- Install Arduino C++ plug-ins from CDT
- When you launch, set the -Dorg.eclipse.cdt.arduino.home=/Users/dschaefer/arduino/arduino,
and point it to the root directory of your Arduino IDE.
- Place the arduino.mk file into the root of you're Arduino IDE directory.

Note that we're really close to getting this all packaged and into the Marketplace.
